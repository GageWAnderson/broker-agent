# ADR 000: Template

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Should the frontend be an open prompt or a structured setup with numbers and sliders?

## Decision
MVP should use a structured setup with numbers and sliders. This allows more control over the internal state of the tool.

## Consequences
- Positive: Increases predictability of the tool and reliability.
- Negative: Less flexible, constrains the user to a single way of interacting with the tool.
- Risk: Looks less impressive to users even though there is an agent underlying it.

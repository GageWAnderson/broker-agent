      "First, I'll start by importing the necessary modules from playwright.async_api. That includes async_playwright, Browser, BrowserContext, Page, FrameLocator, Locator, Download, Dialog, JSHandle, and APIResponse. Even though some might not be used immediately, it's safer to include them for potential future needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, I'll set up the basic structure using async def main() and await async_playwright(). This is standard practice when working with Playwright's async functionality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user provided placeholder values for the website URL and DOM content. Since I don't have the actual URL or DOM details, I'll use a generic approach. I'll navigate to the given URL using page.goto(). After navigation, it's good practice to add a small delay, like await page.wait_for_timeout(1000), to ensure the page loads completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, onto handling the price range. The user wants to click a 'Price' button. In Playwright, I can use page.query_selector() to find the element and then click it with .click(). I'll also add some delays after each interaction for reliability, like clicking, filling out min and max prices, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the price inputs, I need to fill in the min and max values. Using page.fill() with the appropriate selectors will handle that. I'll assume the min price selector is \"input[name='minPrice']\", and similarly for max.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the 'Bedrooms' dropdown needs to be clicked and set to 'Studio'. I'll query the select element, click it, and then evaluate JavaScript to change the value. Sometimes, using page.select_option() might not work if the dropdown isn't a standard <select> element, so using JS to set the value is more reliable.\n",
